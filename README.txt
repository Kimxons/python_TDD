This is a simple python program on TDD. The program checks whether a word is a palindrome or not. 
This is implemented using Stack Data structure in python. 

Use Case:
Allows the user to input a word or word phrase.By traversing the word or word phrase either backwards or forward, the word should be read the same from front-to-back and from back-to-front.


A palindrome is a word that is read the same from front-to-back and from back-to-front.
implemented by traversing the given word or phrase forwards and backwards
to check whether it is the same
using a stack D.S to find palindromes
